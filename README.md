# Traffic-jam-prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts traffic jams and explores the relationship between traffic congestion and its impact on climate change. By leveraging historical traffic data and climate-related information, we can gain insights into the environmental consequences of traffic congestion.

# Model Development
The machine learning model development process involves the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing: The traffic and climate data are cleaned, merged, and preprocessed to create a unified dataset for training and evaluation.

- Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted from the dataset, such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and historical traffic patterns.

- Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms, such as regression, time series analysis, or classification models, are implemented and trained on the preprocessed data.

- Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), to assess their performance in predicting traffic jams.



# Future Enhancements
This project provides a foundation for further exploration and enhancements. Here are some potential areas for improvement:

- Incorporating real-time data feeds to enable real-time traffic jam predictions and more accurate climate impact analysis.

- Developing visualizations to showcase the correlation between traffic congestion, climate conditions, and environmental consequences.

- Deployment of forcasting model that predicts the congestion level into the future an therfor it can be used as a recommendation system for drivers to avoid these areas and therfore reduce it's impact on climate change


# Conclusion
By predicting traffic jams and studying their impact on climate change, this project aims to raise awareness about the environmental consequences of traffic congestion. With accurate predictions and
